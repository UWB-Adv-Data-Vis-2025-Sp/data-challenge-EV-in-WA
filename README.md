# Description

The central challenge this dashboard seeks to address is: How can data-driven visualizations help us understand the spread and growth of electric vehicle adoption across Washington State?
As the state pursues ambitious environmental goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to clean energy transportation, understanding where and how electric vehicles are adopted is essential. This dashboard aims to transform raw registration data into accessible, interactive insights that support strategic decisions in policy, business, infrastructure, and research.
The purpose of this dashboard is twofold: to inform and to explore. For stakeholders such as policymakers, transportation planners, and advocacy groups, it provides clear visuals that summarize EV distribution trends and give insights on growth trajectories. For researchers, businesses, and community members, it offers tools for exploring the data through simpler visualizations.
The resulting data visualization dashboard‚Äôs goal is to inform and empower multiple stakeholder groups. Transportation departments can use insights to prioritize infrastructure deployment, such as new charging stations in underserved areas. Researchers can apply the findings to measure the effectiveness of policy interventions, while clean energy advocates can use the visual narratives to communicate progress and identify equity concerns in green technology adoption.

# Proposed Project Plan

The project will span 3-4 weeks with the following phases and tasks:

1. Data Exploration & Design Ideation
-	Data Import
  -	Import the Electric Vehicle Population Data from the Washgington State
  - Clean the pre-processing of the data
- Initial Sketch
  - Define project scope and objectives
  - Brainstorm and sketch initial dashboard layouts
- Meetings:
  -	Discuss roles and responsibilities and set communication channels among team members.
2. Data Analysis and Design
  -	Perform exploratory data analysis
  -	Identify key metrics and trends
  -	Determine which visualizations best address the purpose
3. Dashboard Build & Development
  - Integrate the refined visualizations into an interactive dashboard framework. 
  - Develop interactive filtering and drill-down capabilities.
  - User Interface & Aesthetics:
  - Focus on the dashboard's overall layout, color schemes, and responsiveness.
  - Incorporate the sidebar with filtering options and a dynamic header.     
4. Testing, Feedback, and Deployment
- Conduct usability testing and gather feedback:
    - Share the dashboard with a small group of target users (stakeholders, peers) to collect feedback on usability and insights.
    - Identify and fix any bugs or usability issues.
- Final Adjustments & Deployment:
    - Finalize the dashboard design, ensuring all visualizations and interactive elements work as intended.
    - Deploy the dashboard on a hosting platform and ensure the live data connection functions.
- Documentation & Final Presentation:
    - Document the design process, coding decisions, and any challenges faced.
    - Prepare a final presentation outlining the project‚Äôs insights and outcomes.
